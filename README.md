# Clothing-and-Accessory-Recommendation-System(with Deep Learning)
A clothing and accessory recommendation system can help users discover new items that match their personal style and preferences according to the image uploaded by the users. This project presents a clothing and accessory recommendation system that utilizes Convolutional Neural Network and Nearest Neighbour algorithm. The system trains neural networks and creates a database of the inventory items. It then uses the nearest neighbour algorithm to find the most relevant products based on the input image, generating recommendations for users.

## Dataset 
dataset text file has its link where its directed towards kaggle

## Installation

Use pip to install the requirements.

--bash
pip install -r requirements.txt

##Deployment --Streamlit
Streamlit provides an intuitive way to build custom web applications without requiring extensive knowledge of web development or front-end programming. With Streamlit, you can create a variety of data-driven applications, such as dashboards, data exploration tools, and machine learning models, among others.
## Usage

To run the web server, simply execute streamlit with the main recommender app:

--bash
streamlit run main.py
